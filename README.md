Infrastructure as Code - Web Server Provisioning Script (Apache)


In this project a script was developed where a web server will be automatically provisioned. A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main job of a web server is to display website content by storing, processing and delivering web pages to users.
